A full game!


overview
--------


  * `Button.h` - Generic button class
  * `Buzzer.h` - Sound output class, including musical tones
  * `CheckError.h` - Utility macro for printing helpful errors to serial
  * `DiabloSerial.h` - Custom 4D Systems serial controller class
  * `Game.h` - **Primary game logic**
  * `IntervalTimer` - Generic timer class
  * `Joystick.h` - Joystick class
  * `Motor.h` - Classes for both the ordinary and stepper motors
  * `Path.h` - Class for reading and using the binary path file from the SD card
  * `Position.h` - common Position type
  * `Screen.h` - ??? (I, uh, am not actually sure what this is? Further research is needed...)
  * `ScreenView.h` - Abstraction class over the DiabloSerial class to make displaying images easier
  * `XYTable.h` - Combines two `Stepper`s into a more abstract class
  * `offsets.h` - GCI image offsets file, auto-generated by `gci-encoder`

There are also two build scripts, `compile` and `upload` that use the Arduino CLI to automatically build and upload the program. This is not necessary to use it; however, the compile script takes a `--mirror` flag that defines a `MIRROR_TABLE` macro for you. If you don't use the build scripts, you'll need to define that macro yourself for the two mirrored tables (the ones with the joystick on the right).
